<p><strong>The Ghost Writer Sinopsis</strong>. The novel tells the story of Nathan Zuckerman a young writer at the beginning of his career who has sought out EI. The Ghost Writer is energetic engaging and beautifully written but what separates it from some of Roths others is that it is also in a sense a mystery novel. The Ghost finds out that Adam has links to a professor from Cambridge who was working for the CIA. Harris based the characters of the Prime Minister and his wife very closely on his former friend Tony Blair and Blairs wife Cherie.</p>
