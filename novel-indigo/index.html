<p>Based on historical documents including Elizas letters this is a historical fiction account of how a teenage girl produced indigo dye which became one of the largest exports out of South Carolina an export that laid the foundation for the incredible wealth of several Southern families who still live on today. Indigo by Alice Hoffman is set in a mythical town of Oak Grove blocked off from water since the big flood several years before. My admiration for pioneers of the romance genre is immeasurable but 22-year-old romance novels dont always age well. The characters are rich well defined funny strong smart clever heart-breaking and unrelenting. Indigo is a shimmering lyrical novel about power and transformation. Anyone who comes near them immediately suffers from nausea and vertigo.</p>
